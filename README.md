# LengthToInches
I developed Length to Inch converter web-2 based website.
We can easily convert length to inch by easily subsuiting length in my web.

HTML:
  HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language.
  I used html to make skeleton of this website.
  Basically the html will give the structure of the website.

  CSS - Cascading Style Sheet.
  Css is basically used to design the website.

JavaScript:

  Js makes our website dynamically.
